📊 Global E-commerce Performance Analysis
Project Goal
An end-to-end analysis of revenue trends and user conversion funnel for a global e-commerce platform using SQL (BigQuery), Python, and Tableau.

Key Technical Steps
SQL (BigQuery): Data extraction using CTEs, joining session/user tables, and using Window Functions (DENSE_RANK, SUM OVER) for market ranking.

Python (Pandas): Data cleaning, EDA, and calculating correlations between user traffic and final revenue.

Tableau: Built an interactive dashboard featuring a Global Performance Matrix (Heatmap) with separate color legends for Revenue, Sessions, and Registration %.

Top Business Insights
High Potential: Identified Taiwan as a leader in registration efficiency (8.5%).

Optimization Gap: France shows high traffic but lower-than-average conversion (7.6%), signaling a need for sign-up process UX improvements.

Retention: Data suggests a drop-off in user activity after 4 weeks; recommended personalized re-engagement campaigns.
